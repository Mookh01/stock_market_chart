# stock_market_chart
A FreeCodeCamp challenge that searches and displays stock prices on a line chart. This application uses Google Charts API, yfinance API, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io and Embedded Javascript(EJS)

# Working Application
https://morning-shore-54022.herokuapp.com/

# Objective: 
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

User Story: I can remove stocks.

User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.

# Challenges
The biggest obstacles I had was using the Google Charts and familiarizing myself with the Javascripts HTML DOM, socket.io and EJS. Having used Javascript in Node.js, I wanted to use more of what I'd consider the traditional Javascript functionality, such as; "getElementById()", "createElement()", "getElementsByTagName()", etc. I've used a lot of JQuery for this and node.js libraries. 
As for Google Charts, because I enjoy learning hands on I tried to manipulate and play with a few different charts but kept struggling with the style and look of them. I finally read the documentation and figured out that there were different line chart types with different syntax which gave me the problems.  Once I went with the classical style of line charts I was on my way to building the chart I wanted. A consistent theme I run into is the language used in these guides. I find them consistently vague and the creators seem to assume the reader understands aspects of the guide implicitly.
